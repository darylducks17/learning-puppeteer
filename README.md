## What is Front End Performance Testing?

- Frontend performance testing evaluates the speed and responsiveness of a website or web application from the user’s perspective.
- A frontend performance test is usually performed to ensure that an application's end-user experience is ideal.
- It is an interface-level test that measures round-trip metrics to identify issues like rendering speed, UI lags, and sudden shifts in page elements.
- The fewer the requests and the quicker the response times, the better the frontend performance.

## Front End vs Back End Performance Testing

- Front End
  - Testing the user interface visible to the user.
  - Typically black box testing as this means you don’t require knowledge of the underlying code.
  - Front end testing is the process of testing the frontend side of the application to ensure there are no glitches, functionality breaks or significant problems present in the application.
  - A well driven front end test makes the product bug free and ensures the user will get a great user-experience.
- Back End
  - Back end testing ensures an application’s database and server-side functionality are working as intended.
  - Typically white box, meaning the tester will interact with the code logic behind any functionality.
  - We use JMeter for API endpoint testing which is a backend testing technique.

### How can we benefit from Front End Testing

- Frontend performance testing allows businesses to explore the user interface and ensure that every element loads efficiently.
- Speed is synonymous with efficiency.
- Optimising page load times through frontend performance testing is the key to addressing this issue and retaining customers.
- Frontend performance testing helps businesses identify and resolve load-related issues before a website or application is launched.

### Key Metrics for Performance Front End Testing

- **Performance Score**
  - This is a comprehensive rating that takes into account various aspects of page performance.
- **Speed Index**
  - This metric measures the average time it takes for all visible parts of a page to load.
  - A lower Speed Index indicates that the content is loading quickly, which is essential for keeping users engaged.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
  - FCP measures the time it takes for the first piece of content to appear on the screen.
  - This is a critical moment in the user experience, as it gives the impression that the page is loading and functioning correctly.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**
  - TTI tracks how long it takes for a page to become fully interactive, meaning that users can click on buttons, fill out forms, or interact with other elements without delay.
  - A fast TTI is vital for ensuring that users can engage with the site as soon as possible.
- **First Meaningful Paint (FMP)**
  - This metric measures when the primary content of a page becomes visible. It’s important because it represents the point at which the user feels the page has loaded enough to start engaging with it.
- **Input Latency**
  - Input latency measures the delay between a user’s input (like a click or keystroke) and the page’s response.
  - High input latency can lead to frustration and negatively impact the user experience.
